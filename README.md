## Usage
The app, [Refrigerator Poetry](url), allows you to create, share, and enjoy poetry. To get started, you can create an account or log in. Once you've logged in, you can view your own posts and see the number of upvotes and comments they've received. You can also edit or delete your posts as needed.

To make a new post, you can choose words from the app's word bank or generate related words to get inspiration. You can drag and drop the words to create poetry. Once you've created your poem, you can post it to the feed, where others can read it, upvote it, and leave comments.

In addition to posting your own poetry, you can read and enjoy others' posts, upvote the ones you like, and leave comments to show your appreciation or provide feedback. Refrigerator Poetry is a fun and creative way to express yourself and connect with others who share your love of poetry.
